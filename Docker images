What are images
Docker images are templates used to create Docker containers. Container is a running instance of image.
(Basically images are files which have information about what all things will be required to create a container)
-> Image typically contains a union of layerd filesystems stacked on top of each other.
-> A single image can be used to create multiple containers.
Where are images stored?
Images are stored in Regestries (e.g. Docker Hub). Can be stored locally or remotely.

-> Docker can build images automatically by reading the instructions from a Dockerfile.

Command:
1) docker images: give the list of all images we have

2) docker images --help: will tell about the usage of docker images command

3) docker images -q: only show numeric id's

4) docker images -f filter_name: filter output based on conditions provided.
   e.g. docker images -f "dangling=false" (dangling images are the images which are associated with the containers)
   So in this case I will get those images which are not associated with the containers.
 ->Further you can use this command as: docker images -f "dangling=false" -q => it will give the numeric ids of those images which are not asscoiated with the containers.

5) docker pull image_name: will pull the image from the docker hub (e.g. docker pull ubuntu)
   We can also pull particular version of images e.g. => docker pull ubuntu:18.04 

6) docker run -it ubuntu: used to run container (-it means run container in interactive mode)

7) docker inspect image_name: give all the details of the image.

8) docker rmi image_name: it will remove the image from the docker.
(image cannot be removed while it is being used by the container)
